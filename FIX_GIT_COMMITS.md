# Fix Git Commits to Show Your Name

## The Problem
Your GitHub commits show "Replit-Commit-Author: Agent" instead of your name because Replit automatically commits changes using its system identity.

## Quick Fix - Run These Commands

### Step 1: Set Your Git Identity
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@gmail.com"
```

### Step 2: Create a Clean Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Telegram Channel Monitor - Multi-channel bot with auto-commenting

Complete monitoring system with:
- Multi-channel support (monitor multiple channels simultaneously)
- Auto-commenting with rate limiting (10 comments/hour)
- Cloud deployment ready (Render, Railway, Heroku)
- Session string support for stateless deployment
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Production-ready configuration files"
```

### Step 3: Push Your Changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Complete History Reset

If you want to completely remove Replit's commit history:

```bash
# Remove all git history
rm -rf .git

# Start fresh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release: Telegram Channel Monitor

Professional bot for monitoring Telegram channels with:
- Real-time message detection
- Multi-channel monitoring support  
- Automated commenting with rate limits
- Cloud deployment configurations
- Comprehensive documentation"

# Connect to your GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

## What This Accomplishes

**Before:**
- Commits attributed to "Replit Agent"
- Generic automated messages
- No personal ownership

**After:**
- All commits show your name and email
- Professional commit messages
- Clean project history
- Proper GitHub attribution

Choose the first option if you want to keep existing history, or the second if you want a completely fresh start with your identity from the beginning.
